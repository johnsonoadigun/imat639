I would be talking about the Bay Community support website <a href="https://www.baycss.org/">baycss.org</a> this website delievers services to people living with disabilities. This site is not easy to navigate through. Although the information bar is very visible you go into the website on the top which shouldn't be hard it has everything that you need to look. However, the layout is not user friendly for the population. The flyout menu is so colorful and it has too many pictures covering it.
</p>
<p>This website used italic in design which I think is very attractive but would be difficult for the population they are addressing. The format that was used in this webpage can be confusing to navigate for an individual with disability.
In terms of multimedia, this website contains varieties of posts and newsletters with picture which portrays their story but the selection of color and the contrast of the pictures are very bad, they could have used photoshop to make it more visible, because the population they are serving may include people with low vision.
The interface and navigation of this website is a good one. But the population this website is serving would require the assistant of a family member to comprehend the all the information. It does not properly serve the population.
</p>
<p>
The organization of the webpage in hierarchy term can be confusing for the population that it is serving, though the major buttons are on the top but other information that pertains to the events they do and some information that can be of interests to the population is hard to find. 
</p>

<p>Contrast is a big issue, as I mention above the website is so colorful and it does not help to using like pink and light green on a white background, it is hard to read most of the content on the website. This website used a mix alignment which is good but again the population it serves will find this very difficult. Proximity is bad, the relationship between elements on the webpage doesnâ€™t help the users. The images are not clear and they have letters all over them. The font use does not help the user if he or she is someone with low vision. The grouping of the images is hard to understand also.
</p>





  <p>Finding the website content is quite easy for anyone, when you go on the website your going to see the about us section on the top bar.It is also easy for you to understand the content (product descriptions, services offered, Company information, etc.) However,the graphics of the webpage is not great, the pictures take seconds to load. However, the slides are good, as I mentioned above it could use some photoshop for clarity. The photos are not sharp, they are not good tone and they are blurry, too bright for someone with vision issues which could be a potential user. 
The display type is not impressive the color choice of the font in the display type can be hard to read and the body copy is written in italic which would be difficult for the population to read. It does not reinforce the design theme, it is not well coordinated, it broke the design rule of using no more than 2 or 3 typefaces. Generally, it could have been a better site if the designer took to consideration the population that they are trying to serve.
